    <h3>What is International Women's Day and Its Significance</h3>
    <p>International Women's Day (IWD) is celebrated globally on March 8 every year to recognize the social, cultural,
        economic, and political achievements of women. The day also marks a call to action for accelerating gender
        equality. International Women's Day is a time to reflect on progress made, to celebrate the achievements of
        women and to empower and motivate women around the world. Women's Day was first celebrated in 1911, and since
        then, it has grown to become an important day for individuals and organizations to show their support for
        women's rights and equality.</p>
